## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

2. Configure the bot by editing `index.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  INSTRUMENT: "BTCUSD:DEV", // Change to "BTCUSD" for production
  LEVERAGE: 50,
  ORDER_CASH_QUANTITY: 300, // Adjust based on your account size (in usd)
  INTERVAL_MS: 3000, // 3 seconds between trades
  USE_PRODUCTION: false, // Set to true for production
  WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY: "0x...", // Your wallet private key
};
```

3. **IMPORTANT**: Replace the private key in `index.js` with your own wallet private key.

   - Waits for the configured interval
   - Repeats

3. **Monitoring**:
